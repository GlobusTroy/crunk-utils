# examples system

Purpose: Demonstrate intended composition and usage of addon systems.

High-level design:
- Keep examples minimal, readable, and representative of real integration patterns.
- Show wiring between input, drag/drop, and positioning components.
- Avoid introducing production-only complexity or hidden project-specific assumptions.
